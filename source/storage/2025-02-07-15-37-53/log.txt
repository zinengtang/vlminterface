long_term_plan: 1. Locate Oak Trees: Look around the forested area to identify oak trees. They have a distinct bark and leaf pattern.
2. Approach an Oak Tree: Move towards the nearest oak tree.
3. Harvest Oak Logs: Use the diamond pickaxe to break the oak logs. Collect at least 8 logs.
4. Check Inventory: Ensure you have collected 8 oak logs in your inventory.
5. Coordinate with Friends: If MineflayerBot0 or MineflayerBot2 are available, coordinate with them to efficiently gather the logs or protect each other from potential threats.
6. Return to Base: Once you have collected the logs, return to a safe location or base if necessary.

long_term_plan: 1. **Locate Oak Trees**: Move around the forest to find oak trees. Look for distinct oak leaves and logs.
2. **Harvest Oak Logs**: Use the diamond pickaxe to harvest 8 oak logs. Although not efficient, it will fulfill the task requirement.
3. **Collaborate if Possible**: If other players are nearby, coordinate with them to locate oak trees faster.
4. **Return to Base**: Once the logs are collected, return to a safe location or base to store the logs.
5. **Monitor Durability**: Keep an eye on the pickaxe's durability to ensure it doesn't break during the task.
