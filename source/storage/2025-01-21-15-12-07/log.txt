long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.

long_term_plan: 1. **Clear the Area**: Ensure the area is flat and free of tall grass or flowers to provide a clean foundation for the monument. Use commands to clear if necessary.
2. **Gather Materials**: Use the command `/give @p quartz_block 64` to obtain marble-like blocks (quartz) for the monument. Repeat as needed to gather sufficient materials.
3. **Design the Base**: Plan and construct a large, stable base using the quartz blocks. Consider a square or circular shape for stability and aesthetics.
4. **Build the Monument Body**: Construct a slender, tall structure on top of the base. Use a combination of quartz blocks and possibly other decorative blocks like quartz pillars or stairs for detail.
5. **Add Details**: Enhance the monument with additional features such as arches, columns, or decorative patterns to make it impressive.
6. **Lighting and Landscaping**: Add lighting around the monument using glowstone or sea lanterns. Consider landscaping with paths or gardens to enhance the monument's surroundings.
7. **Collaborate with MineflayerBot1**: Coordinate with the other player to divide tasks, such as one focusing on the base while the other works on the monument body.
8. **Review and Adjust**: Once the monument is complete, review the structure for any improvements or adjustments to enhance its grandeur and impressiveness.
