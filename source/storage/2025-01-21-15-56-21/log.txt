long_term_plan: 1. Use the command `/give @p oak_log 64` to obtain oak logs, which are brown and suitable for building the pillar.
2. Communicate with MineflayerBot1 to coordinate the construction process.
3. Clear a small area of tall grass if necessary to ensure a flat surface for building.
4. Begin constructing the slender pillar by stacking oak logs vertically on the grassy field.
5. Ensure the pillar is slender by keeping the base one block wide.
6. Adjust the height of the pillar as desired, ensuring it maintains a slender appearance.
7. Once the pillar is complete, review the structure with MineflayerBot1 to ensure it meets the goal.
8. Make any necessary adjustments collaboratively to finalize the construction.
