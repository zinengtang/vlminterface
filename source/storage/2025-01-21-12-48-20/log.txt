long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools and a crafting table. 
2. **Craft Basic Tools**: Use the wood to craft a wooden pickaxe and axe, which will help in gathering more resources efficiently. 
3. **Collect Food**: Hunt the nearby sheep for food and wool. Cook the food if possible to restore more hunger points. 
4. **Build Shelter**: Use gathered materials to build a simple shelter to protect against hostile mobs at night. 
5. **Coordinate with MineflayerBot1**: Work together to gather resources and build a shelter more efficiently. Share tasks like gathering, crafting, and building. 
6. **Monitor Health and Hunger**: Keep an eye on health and hunger levels, eating food as necessary to maintain them. 
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid unnecessary combat and stay within the shelter during nighttime to prevent damage from mobs. 
8. **Survive the Time**: Focus on staying alive and maintaining resources until the time goal is reached.
