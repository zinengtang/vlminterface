long_term_plan: 1. Equip the shield in your off-hand to prepare for combat.
2. Approach the skeletons cautiously, using trees for cover to avoid their arrows.
3. Engage one skeleton at a time, using the shield to block incoming arrows.
4. Use the iron sword to attack when close enough, ensuring to keep the shield up when not attacking.
5. After defeating each skeleton, retreat if necessary to regain health and reposition.
6. Repeat the process until all four skeletons are defeated.
7. If a friend is available, coordinate attacks to distract and defeat the skeletons more efficiently.

long_term_plan: 1. Equip the shield in your off-hand to prepare for combat.
2. Approach the skeletons cautiously, using trees for cover to avoid their arrows.
3. Engage one skeleton at a time, using the shield to block incoming arrows.
4. Use the iron sword to attack when close enough, ensuring to keep the shield up when not attacking.
5. After defeating each skeleton, retreat if necessary to regain health and reposition.
6. Repeat the process until all four skeletons are defeated.
7. If a friend is available, coordinate attacks to distract and defeat the skeletons more efficiently.
