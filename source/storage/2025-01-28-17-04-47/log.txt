2. Coordinate with MineflayerBot1 to approach the skeletons together. 
3. Use the trees for cover to avoid being hit by arrows. 
4. Engage the skeletons one by one, using the shield to block arrows and the sword to attack. 
5. Communicate with MineflayerBot1 to ensure you are not overwhelmed by multiple skeletons at once. 
6. After defeating each skeleton, check your health and retreat if necessary to heal.

long_term_plan: 1. Equip the shield in your off-hand from the inventory. 
2. Coordinate with MineflayerBot1 to approach the skeletons together. 
3. Use the trees for cover to avoid being hit by arrows. 
4. Engage the skeletons one by one, using the shield to block arrows and the sword to attack. 
5. Communicate with MineflayerBot1 to ensure you are not overwhelmed by multiple skeletons at once. 
6. After defeating each skeleton, check your health and retreat if necessary to heal. 
7. Continue until all 4 skeletons are defeated.
