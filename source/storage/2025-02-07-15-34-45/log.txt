long_term_plan: 1. **Locate Oak Logs**: Move around the area to find the oak logs within the tree. The presence of oak leaves suggests that logs are nearby.
2. **Harvest Oak Logs**: Use the diamond pickaxe to harvest 8 oak logs. Although a pickaxe is not the ideal tool for wood, it can still be used.
3. **Coordinate with Friends**: Communicate with MineflayerBot0 and MineflayerBot2 to ensure efficient harvesting. They can help locate and gather logs.
4. **Inventory Management**: Ensure there is enough space in the inventory to store the logs. Currently, there are 35 empty slots, which is sufficient.
5. **Complete Task**: Once 8 oak logs are collected, the task is complete. Ensure all logs are safely stored in the inventory.
