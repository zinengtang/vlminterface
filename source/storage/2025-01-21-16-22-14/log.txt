long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools. Use the wood to create a crafting table and wooden tools.
2. **Craft Weapons**: Use the crafting table to make a wooden sword for basic defense.
3. **Find Stone**: Locate stone blocks to upgrade tools to stone variants, which are more effective.
4. **Craft Stone Sword**: Upgrade to a stone sword for better combat capability.
5. **Coordinate with Friend**: Communicate with MineflayerBot1 to gather resources faster or assist in combat.
6. **Locate Zombie**: Move towards the zombie's last known position at (-62.31, 76, -401.49).
7. **Engage Zombie**: Once equipped, engage the zombie in combat, using the stone sword.
8. **Monitor Health**: Keep an eye on health and retreat if necessary to heal.
9. **Defeat Zombie**: Successfully defeat the zombie to complete the task.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools. Use the wood to create a crafting table and wooden tools.
2. **Craft Weapons**: Use the crafting table to make a wooden sword for basic defense.
3. **Find Stone**: Locate stone blocks to upgrade tools to stone variants, which are more effective.
4. **Craft Stone Sword**: Upgrade to a stone sword for better combat capability.
5. **Coordinate with Friend**: Communicate with MineflayerBot1 to gather resources faster or assist in combat.
6. **Locate Zombie**: Move towards the zombie's last known position at (-62.31, 76, -401.49).
7. **Engage Zombie**: Once equipped, engage the zombie in combat, using the stone sword.
8. **Monitor Health**: Keep an eye on health and retreat if necessary to heal.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools. Use the wood to create a crafting table and wooden tools.
2. **Craft Weapons**: Use the crafting table to make a wooden sword for basic defense.
3. **Find Stone**: Locate stone blocks to upgrade tools to stone variants, which are more effective.
4. **Craft Stone Sword**: Upgrade to a stone sword for better combat capability.
5. **Coordinate with Friend**: Communicate with MineflayerBot1 to gather resources faster or assist in combat.
6. **Locate Zombie**: Move towards the zombie's last known position at (-62.31, 76, -401.49).
7. **Engage Zombie**: Once equipped, engage the zombie in combat, using the stone sword.
8. **Monitor Health**: Keep an eye on health and retreat if necessary to heal.
9. **Defeat Zombie**: Successfully defeat the zombie to complete the task.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools. Use the wood to create a crafting table and wooden tools.
2. **Craft Weapons**: Use the crafting table to make a wooden sword for basic defense.
3. **Find Stone**: Locate stone blocks to upgrade tools to stone variants, which are more effective.
4. **Craft Stone Sword**: Upgrade to a stone sword for better combat capability.
5. **Coordinate with Friend**: Communicate with MineflayerBot1 to gather resources faster or assist in combat.
6. **Locate Zombie**: Move towards the zombie's last known position at (-62.31, 76, -401.49).
7. **Engage Zombie**: Once equipped, engage the zombie in combat, using the stone sword.
8. **Monitor Health**: Keep an eye on health and retreat if necessary to heal.
9. **Defeat Zombie**: Successfully defeat the zombie to complete the task.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools. Use the wood to create a crafting table and wooden tools.
2. **Craft Weapons**: Use the crafting table to make a wooden sword for basic defense.
3. **Find Stone**: Locate stone blocks to upgrade tools to stone variants, which are more effective.
4. **Craft Stone Sword**: Upgrade to a stone sword for better combat capability.
5. **Coordinate with Friend**: Communicate with MineflayerBot1 to gather resources faster or assist in combat.
6. **Locate Zombie**: Move towards the zombie's last known position at (-62.31, 76, -401.49).
7. **Engage Zombie**: Once equipped, engage the zombie in combat, using the stone sword.
8. **Monitor Health**: Keep an eye on health and retreat if necessary to heal.
9. **Defeat Zombie**: Successfully defeat the zombie to complete the task.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools. Use the wood to create a crafting table and wooden tools.
2. **Craft Weapons**: Use the crafting table to make a wooden sword for basic defense.
3. **Find Stone**: Locate stone blocks to upgrade tools to stone variants, which are more effective.
4. **Craft Stone Sword**: Upgrade to a stone sword for better combat capability.
5. **Coordinate with Friend**: Communicate with MineflayerBot1 to gather resources faster or assist in combat.
6. **Locate Zombie**: Move towards the zombie's last known position at (-62.31, 76, -401.49).
7. **Engage Zombie**: Once equipped, engage the zombie in combat, using the stone sword.
8. **Monitor Health**: Keep an eye on health and retreat if necessary to heal.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools. Use the wood to create a crafting table and wooden tools.
2. **Craft Weapons**: Use the crafting table to make a wooden sword for basic defense.
3. **Find Stone**: Locate stone blocks to upgrade tools to stone variants, which are more effective.
4. **Craft Stone Sword**: Upgrade to a stone sword for better combat capability.
5. **Coordinate with Friend**: Communicate with MineflayerBot1 to gather resources faster or assist in combat.
6. **Locate Zombie**: Move towards the zombie's last known position at (-62.31, 76, -401.49).
7. **Engage Zombie**: Once equipped, engage the zombie in combat, using the stone sword.
8. **Monitor Health**: Keep an eye on health and retreat if necessary to heal.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools. Use the wood to create a crafting table and wooden tools.
2. **Craft Weapons**: Use the crafting table to make a wooden sword for basic defense.
3. **Find Stone**: Locate stone blocks to upgrade tools to stone variants, which are more effective.
4. **Craft Stone Sword**: Upgrade to a stone sword for better combat capability.
5. **Coordinate with Friend**: Communicate with MineflayerBot1 to gather resources faster or assist in combat.
6. **Locate Zombie**: Move towards the zombie's last known position at (-62.31, 76, -401.49).
7. **Engage Zombie**: Once equipped, engage the zombie in combat, using the stone sword.
8. **Monitor Health**: Keep an eye on health and retreat if necessary to heal.
9. **Defeat Zombie**: Successfully defeat the zombie to complete the task.

long_term_plan: 1. **Gather Resources**: Start by collecting wood from nearby trees to craft basic tools. Use the wood to create a crafting table and wooden tools.
2. **Craft Weapons**: Use the crafting table to make a wooden sword for basic defense.
3. **Find Stone**: Locate stone blocks to upgrade tools to stone variants, which are more effective.
4. **Craft Stone Sword**: Upgrade to a stone sword for better combat capability.
5. **Coordinate with Friend**: Communicate with MineflayerBot1 to gather resources faster or assist in combat.
6. **Locate Zombie**: Move towards the zombie's last known position at (-62.31, 76, -401.49).
7. **Engage Zombie**: Once equipped, engage the zombie in combat, using the stone sword.
8. **Monitor Health**: Keep an eye on health and retreat if necessary to heal.
9. **Defeat Zombie**: Successfully defeat the zombie to complete the task.
