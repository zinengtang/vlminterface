long_term_plan: 1. Equip the shield in your off-hand slot from the inventory.
2. Communicate with MineflayerBot1 to coordinate the attack strategy.
3. Approach the skeletons cautiously, using trees for cover to avoid their arrows.
4. Use the shield to block incoming arrows while closing the distance to the skeletons.
5. Attack the skeletons with the iron sword, focusing on one at a time to reduce their numbers quickly.
6. Retreat if necessary to regain health and regroup with MineflayerBot1.
7. Continue the attack until all skeletons are defeated, ensuring to use the shield effectively to minimize damage.
