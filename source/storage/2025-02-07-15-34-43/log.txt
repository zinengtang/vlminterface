long_term_plan: 1. Locate Oak Trees: Move towards the trees visible in the image to find oak trees.
2. Harvest Oak Logs: Use the diamond pickaxe to break and collect 8 oak logs from the oak trees.
3. Collaborate with Friends: If other players are present, coordinate with them to efficiently gather the logs, ensuring everyone contributes to the task.
4. Monitor Inventory: Keep track of the number of oak logs collected to ensure the goal of 8 logs is met.
5. Return to Base: Once the logs are collected, return to a safe location or base to store the logs if necessary.
