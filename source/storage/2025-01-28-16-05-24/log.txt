long_term_plan: 1. Equip the Shield: Open your inventory and equip the shield in your off-hand slot to prepare for combat.
2. Coordinate with MineflayerBot1: Communicate with your friend to plan a strategy for attacking the skeletons together.
3. Approach the Skeletons: Move towards the skeletons cautiously, using the trees for cover to avoid taking damage from arrows.
4. Engage in Combat: Use the shield to block incoming arrows and attack the skeletons with your iron sword. Focus on one skeleton at a time to reduce their numbers quickly.
5. Retreat if Necessary: If your health drops too low, retreat to a safe distance to regenerate health before re-engaging.
6. Repeat Until All Skeletons are Defeated: Continue the process until all four skeletons are defeated, ensuring to support MineflayerBot1 as needed.

2. Coordinate with MineflayerBot1: Communicate with your friend to plan a strategy for attacking the skeletons together.
3. Approach the Skeletons: Move towards the skeletons cautiously, using the trees for cover to avoid taking damage from arrows.
4. Engage in Combat: Use the shield to block incoming arrows and attack the skeletons with your iron sword. Focus on one skeleton at a time to reduce their numbers quickly.
5. Retreat if Necessary: If your health drops too low, retreat to a safe distance to regenerate health before re-engaging.
6. Repeat Until All Skeletons are Defeated: Continue the process until all four skeletons are defeated, ensuring to support MineflayerBot1 as needed.

2. Coordinate with MineflayerBot1: Communicate with your friend to plan a strategy for attacking the skeletons together.
3. Approach the Skeletons: Move towards the skeletons cautiously, using the trees for cover to avoid taking damage from arrows.
4. Engage in Combat: Use the shield to block incoming arrows and attack the skeletons with your iron sword. Focus on one skeleton at a time to reduce their numbers quickly.
5. Retreat if Necessary: If your health drops too low, retreat to a safe distance to regenerate health before re-engaging.
