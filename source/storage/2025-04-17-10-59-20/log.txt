long_term_plan: 1. Use the command /give to obtain a large quantity of oak logs. For example, /give @p oak_log 1000.
2. Craft the oak logs into oak planks using the crafting interface.
3. Clear a flat area in the forest for the house foundation if necessary.
4. Plan the layout of the house, considering the size and design you want.
5. Begin constructing the house by laying down the foundation with oak planks.
6. Build the walls, leaving spaces for windows and doors.
7. Construct the roof using oak planks or other materials for variety.
8. Add details such as windows, doors, and interior decorations.
9. Work with MineflayerBot0 to speed up the construction process and share tasks.
10. Review the house and make any necessary adjustments or improvements.

long_term_plan: 1. Use the command /give to obtain a large quantity of oak logs. For example, /give @p oak_log 1000.
2. Craft the oak logs into oak planks using the crafting interface.
3. Clear a flat area in the forest for the house foundation if necessary.
4. Plan the layout of the house, considering the size and design you want.
5. Begin constructing the house by laying down the foundation with oak planks.
6. Build the walls, leaving spaces for windows and doors.
7. Construct the roof using oak planks or other materials for variety.
8. Add details such as windows, doors, and interior decorations.
9. Work with MineflayerBot0 to speed up the construction process and share tasks.

long_term_plan: 1. Use the command /give to obtain a large quantity of oak logs. For example, /give @p oak_log 1000.
2. Craft the oak logs into oak planks using the crafting interface.
3. Clear a flat area in the forest for the house foundation if necessary.
4. Plan the layout of the house, considering the size and design you want.
5. Begin constructing the house by laying down the foundation with oak planks.
6. Build the walls, leaving spaces for windows and doors.
7. Construct the roof using oak planks or other materials for variety.
8. Add details such as windows, doors, and interior decorations.
9. Work with MineflayerBot0 to speed up the construction process and share tasks.
10. Review the house and make any necessary adjustments or improvements.

long_term_plan: 1. Use the command /give to obtain a large quantity of oak logs. For example, /give @p oak_log 1000.
2. Craft the oak logs into oak planks using the crafting interface.
3. Clear a flat area in the forest for the house foundation if necessary.
4. Plan the layout of the house, considering the size and design you want.
5. Begin constructing the house by laying down the foundation with oak planks.
6. Build the walls, leaving spaces for windows and doors.
7. Construct the roof using oak planks or other materials for variety.
8. Add details such as windows, doors, and interior decorations.
9. Work with MineflayerBot0 to speed up the construction process and share tasks.
10. Review the house and make any necessary adjustments or improvements.
