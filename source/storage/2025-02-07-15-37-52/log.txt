long_term_plan: 1. Identify Oak Trees: Look around to identify oak trees in the vicinity. The image suggests there are trees nearby.
2. Approach an Oak Tree: Move towards the nearest oak tree.
3. Harvest Oak Logs: Use the diamond pickaxe to break and collect 8 oak logs from the tree. Ensure you have enough inventory space.
4. Verify Task Completion: Check your inventory to confirm you have collected 8 oak logs.
5. Collaborate if Needed: If you have friends in the game, coordinate with them to complete the task efficiently, though it's not necessary for this task.
