long_term_plan: 1. Equip the shield in your off-hand to prepare for combat. 
2. Coordinate with MineflayerBot1 to approach the skeletons together, ensuring you both have a plan to attack and defend. 
3. Use the trees and terrain for cover to avoid taking damage from the skeletons' arrows. 
4. Engage the skeletons one at a time, using the shield to block incoming arrows and the sword to attack. 
5. Communicate with MineflayerBot1 to focus on the same skeleton to quickly reduce their numbers. 
6. After defeating each skeleton, check your health and retreat if necessary to heal before re-engaging. 
7. Continue this strategy until all four skeletons are defeated.

2. Coordinate with MineflayerBot1 to approach the skeletons together, ensuring you both have a plan to attack and defend. 
3. Use the trees and terrain for cover to avoid taking damage from the skeletons' arrows.

5. Communicate with MineflayerBot1 to focus on the same skeleton to quickly reduce their numbers.

long_term_plan: 1. Equip the shield in your off-hand to prepare for combat. 
2. Coordinate with MineflayerBot1 to approach the skeletons together, ensuring you both have a plan to attack and defend. 
3. Use the trees and terrain for cover to avoid taking damage from the skeletons' arrows. 
4. Engage the skeletons one at a time, using the shield to block incoming arrows and the sword to attack. 
5. Communicate with MineflayerBot1 to focus on the same skeleton to quickly reduce their numbers. 
6. After defeating each skeleton, check your health and retreat if necessary to heal before re-engaging. 
7. Continue this strategy until all four skeletons are defeated.

long_term_plan: 1. Equip the shield in your off-hand to prepare for combat. 
2. Coordinate with MineflayerBot1 to approach the skeletons together, ensuring you both have a plan to attack and defend. 
3. Use the trees and terrain for cover to avoid taking damage from the skeletons' arrows. 
4. Engage the skeletons one at a time, using the shield to block incoming arrows and the sword to attack. 
5. Communicate with MineflayerBot1 to focus on the same skeleton to quickly reduce their numbers. 
6. After defeating each skeleton, check your health and retreat if necessary to heal before re-engaging. 
7. Continue this strategy until all four skeletons are defeated.
