long_term_plan: 1. Identify Oak Trees: Look around to identify oak trees in the vicinity. Oak trees have distinct leaves and bark. 
2. Approach an Oak Tree: Move towards the nearest oak tree. 
3. Harvest Oak Logs: Use the diamond pickaxe to break and collect 8 oak logs from the tree. 
4. Work with a Friend: If a friend is available, coordinate to gather the logs more efficiently, perhaps by having one person break the logs while the other collects them. 
5. Verify Completion: Ensure that 8 oak logs are collected in the inventory. 
6. Return to Base: If necessary, return to a safe location to store the logs.

long_term_plan: 1. Locate an oak tree nearby, as indicated by the presence of oak leaves. 
2. Approach the oak tree and use the diamond pickaxe to harvest 8 oak logs. 
3. Ensure the inventory has enough space to store the logs. 
4. If needed, clear any obstacles or leaves to access the logs more easily. 
5. Once 8 oak logs are collected, the task is complete.
